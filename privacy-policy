- **No Tracking:** AutoConnect does not track your activity or usage outside of its intended purpose.  

## Permissions  
The permissions requested by AutoConnect are strictly for its functionality:

We do not use these permissions for any purposes beyond what is necessary for the extensionâ€™s functionality.  

## Third-Party Services
